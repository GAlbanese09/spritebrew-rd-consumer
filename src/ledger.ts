// Release 2's D1 ledger library (n1-release-2-spec.md revision 9, 6.1): the
// batches of 4.1 to 4.16, the identity reads, the classifiers and the dev
// faults of 10.3. Built in S1; nothing in release 1 imports it yet (S3 and S4
// wire it in).
//
// Pages copy: spritebrew/src/lib/ledger.ts. Everything below this header is
// identical in both repos; S1's tests compare the two files.
// BEGIN SHARED
//
// The SQL below is the spec's, statement by statement, as written (A9);
// S1's harness checks every constant against the spec's text. The spec
// writes named parameters (:name); D1 binds only ordered ones (?NNN), so
// toPositional() maps each name to a number, skipping string literals and
// comments, and every call binds every name it uses.
//
// Conventions (4.0): every batch is one db.batch() (one transaction); every
// execution binds a fresh :id; the outcome comes from the batch's own last
// statement; a thrown UNIQUE on ledger.idem_key or jobs.job_id goes to the
// identity read; any other error, a timeout or a lost response included, is
// uncertain and the identity read decides; a failed identity read is an
// error. A UNIQUE on any other column is an error outright (T0: a reused :id
// is refused, never read back as ours).
//
// Dev faults (10.3), read from the dev_fault control row only when appEnv is
// 'dev': batch_throw_before:<scope> fails before the batch is sent, and
// batch_response_lost:<scope> sends it and then throws. Scopes: a movement's
// :reason (4.1), 'opening', 'generation', 'claim', 'submitted', 'task',
// 'fallback', 'release', 'stage', 'success', 'generation_failed_refund',
// 'tombstone', 'delivered_finish', 'hold', 'stripe_refusal', 'stripe_pending',
// 'resolution', 'unpause', 'kill_switch'. A fault with no scope never fires.
